While using Flipbox - Awesomes Flip Boxes Image Overlay please make sure that thumbnail images are linked directly to their larger counterpart, not to a dynamic WordPress page that includes the larger image. That means when you add an image in your new flip settings, you need to select File URL at the Link option instead of Page URL. That is for the direct image file, not any other file that is not consists of images. You’ll have to manually edit your old posts if you have always inserted images with Page URL before, Flip Box or any other plugin like that cannot import images from the outer link for you.

You’ll need to make sure that you have all the needed media and their Auto-detect options activated on your Settings > Media library page. If you are using images in other formats like JPG, GIF or PNG, you need to add the extensions with the image link to the Auto-detect the field for Images. Please note that the image file names must actaully end with that image file extension. This means that if you have an image file that (for example) has no extension (does not end with .jpg or any other) even if is in JPEG compressed format, the Flip Box and Image Overlay will not be able to detect is as an image. And as a result you’ll get no image at all on your flip box. You will need to manually give those.
